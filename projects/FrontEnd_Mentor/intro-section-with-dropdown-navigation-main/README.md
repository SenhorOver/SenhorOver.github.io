## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned about animations with css, I studied animations but I never had implemented in any of my projects, it's not hard, the major problem is, what animations I'll use, but, if the animation was a little more detailed, it would be hard for me.

- Animation was the only thing I 'learned', but I had problems with a lot of things I already knew.

### Continued development

- My first problem was the mobile menu, I decided to do a animation for the menu, It's not a beautiful animation, but it was good for training.
- My second problem was the svg sizes on the submenu, I didn't know how rezise it, I searched and the solution was the viewbox attribute, I didn't understand well how it works, but I changed the size.
- I had some problems with the clients svg sizes, I 'fixed' it changing only the width of the svgs and changing the flex-direction to column, I don't understand the viewbox attibute yet.
- I don't like how I did the JavaScript, I could to better, I think I'm started on the right way, but I didn't code well, It has a lot of classList.remove and add, and I probably could do better.
- My major problem in this project was the responsivity, I couldn't code a good responsivity, and I fixed it with a lot of media queries, I'm with problem in that area, I'll focus on doing more responsivity in my projects and learn the best pratices for it.
- I didn't like the result, I can do better. I'll do only one more project, and I will come back to the study, and learn a new framework like Tailwind CSS and React.js

### Useful resources

- I searched a lot of things, but I don't remember any of then, but I didn't copied any code, I just searched to remeber and to confirm some thoughts
