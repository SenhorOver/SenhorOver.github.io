## Overview

- I tried to write all my comments in english, but I'm Brazilian, so, if there is any mistake I feel sorry, I didn't checked in any Translate app

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Nothing new, this website was made with everthing I already know.

### Continued development

- I didn't had to search for anything new, all the website was made by myself, because of that, There's a lot of bad pratices, I'll start a course, and this course has activities of coding an entire layout, so, I think I will learn better pretices, but right now, I still don't know, and my websites will be made with only my knowledge. Maybe my problem is to not know how to mix the codes together in a good way
