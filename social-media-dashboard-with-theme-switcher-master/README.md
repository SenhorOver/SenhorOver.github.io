## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Nothing new, I don't know the best way to change the colors, but In that way worked, its a simple design, but if the website was bigger and has more funcionalities, probably this way its not adequate.

### Continued development

- I don't know GRID yet, because of that I didn't implemented it, but flexbox did a nice work on this design.

- I'll stop doing this projects for now to train a little bit more and learn new things: GRID, Tailwind CSS, React.js, and I wanna learn backend as well.

### Useful resources

- Nothing external
