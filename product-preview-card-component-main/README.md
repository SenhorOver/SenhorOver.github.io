## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- This project was my first project in this website, but I didn't learned nothing new, I need to do more difficult and bigger projects

### Continued development

- I tried to do a responsive layout for this design, but I don't know yet a good pratice for it, I did what I know, whit my current
  knowledge, but I think I still need to do way more projects, and bigger projects to train my code for responsive designs
- When I was coding, I didn't used the relative unit 'em', but I remember that would be good to use, because I needed to change only the
  font-size of body, instead of changing every font-size, but I could add this unit in line-height too, but I forgot

### Useful resources

- I didn't used any external resourse
